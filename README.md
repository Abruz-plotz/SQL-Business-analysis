### Data Cleaning:

```sql
set sql_safe_updates = 0;

update customer_churn
join (select round(avg(WarehouseToHome),0) as avg_WarehouseToHome from customer_churn)
a on 1=1 set customer_churn.WarehouseToHome = a.avg_WarehouseToHome
where customer_churn.WarehouseToHome is null;

update customer_churn
join (select round(avg(HourSpendOnApp),0) as avg_HourSpendOnApp  from customer_churn)
a on 1=1 set customer_churn.HourSpendOnApp = a.avg_HourSpendOnApp
where customer_churn.HourSpendOnApp is null;
    
update customer_churn
join (select round(avg(OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear),0) as avg_OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear from customer_churn)
a on 1=1 set customer_churn.OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear=a.avg_OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear
where customer_churn.OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear is null;
    
update customer_churn
join (select round(avg(DaySinceLastOrder),0) as avg_DaySinceLastOrder from customer_churn)

### Dealing with Inconsistencies

```sql   
   update customer_churn 
   set PreferredPaymentMode = case
   when PreferredPaymentMode = 'cc' then 'Credit Card'
   when PreferredPaymentMode = 'cod' then 'Cash on Delivery'
   else PreferredPaymentMode
   end,
   PreferredLoginDevice = case
   when PreferredLoginDevice = 'Phone' then 'Mobile Phone'
   else PreferredLoginDevice
   end,
   PreferedOrderCat = case 
   when PreferedOrderCat = 'Mobile' then 'Mobile Phone'
   else PreferedOrderCat 
   end;
   
Select * from customer_churn;
```

### Data Transformation: 
###### Column Renaming and Creating New Columns

```sql 
alter table customer_churn
rename column PreferedOrderCat to PreferredOrderCat,
rename column HourSpendOnApp to HoursSpentOnApp,
add column ComplaintReceived varchar(50),
add column ChurnStatus varchar(50);

update customer_churn 
set ComplaintReceived  = case
when Complain = 1 then 'Yes'
else 'No'
end,
ChurnStatus = case
when churn = 1 then 'Churned'
else 'Active'
end;

-- Column Dropping

alter table customer_churn
drop column churn,
drop column complain;

select * from customer_churn;
```

### Data Exploration and Analysis
  <!-- -- Question D -->

```sql 
select  sum(case when churnStatus = 'Churned' then 1 else 0 end) as Count_of_Churned,
		 sum(case when churnStatus = 'Active' then 1 else 0 end) as Count_of_Active 
from customer_churn;

select avg(Tenure),sum(CashbackAmount) as Total_Cashback,count(CashbackAmount) as Number_of_customers
from customer_churn
where churnStatus = 'Churned';
```
![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abruz-plotz/SQL-Business-analysis/main/Screenshots%20for%20GithubSQL/count.png)


```sql 
Select 
cast((Select count(*) from customer_churn
where churnStatus = 'Churned' and ComplaintReceived = 'Yes') as DECIMAL(10, 2)) * 100 / 
(select count(*) from customer_churn
where churnStatus = 'Churned') as Percentage_of_Churned_Customers_complained;
```
**Analysis No.4 :-** City tier with the highest number of churned customers whose preferred order category is "Laptop & Accessory".

```sql
  SELECT CityTier,
    COUNT(CustomerID) as Churned_Customer_count FROM customer_churn
where churnStatus = 'Churned' and PreferredOrderCat='Laptop & Accessory'
  GROUP BY CityTier
  ORDER BY Churned_Customer_count DESC limit 1;
```


**Analysis No.5 :-** The most preferred payment mode among active customers.

```sql  
  select PreferredPaymentMode as PreferredPaymentMode_AmongActive, count(CustomerID) AS No_of_Customers_Used from customer_churn
  where churnStatus = 'Active'
  group by PreferredPaymentMode
  order by No_of_Customers_Used DESC limit 1;
```

**Analysis No.6 :-** Total order amount hike from last year for customers who are single and prefer mobile phones for ordering.

```sql
Select sum(OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear) as Total_Order_Amount_Hike from customer_churn
where MaritalStatus='Single' and PreferredOrderCat='Mobile Phone';
```
